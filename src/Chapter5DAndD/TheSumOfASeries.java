5.13 (The Sum of a Series) Find the summation of the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 â€¦ n, where
n ranges from 1 to 100. Use type long. Display the results in a tabular format that shows n and the
corresponding sum. If this were a product instead of a sum, what difficulty might you encounter

Answer:
At initialization point where total = 0, all the summation will always be 0. To avoid this, total has to be 1 so as to avoid that logic error.
