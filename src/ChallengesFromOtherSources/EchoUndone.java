/*You can compute the distance to a large object, such as a rock wall, by
        timing the echo. For example, if you clap your hands and time how long it takes for you
        to hear the echo, then you know the total round-trip time. Dividing this value by two
        yields the time it takes the sound to go one way. You can then use this value to compute
        the distance to the object. Modify the preceding program so that it computes the distance,
        assuming that the time interval is that of an echo.
