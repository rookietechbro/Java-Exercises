1.3.46 Euler’s sum-of-powers conjecture. In 1769 Leonhard Euler formulated a
generalized version of Fermat’s Last Theorem, conjecturing that at least n nth powers are needed to obtain a sum that is itself an nth power, for n > 2. Write a program
to disprove Euler’s conjecture (which stood until 1967), using a quintuply nested
loop to find four positive integers whose 5th power sums to the 5th power of another positive integer. That is, find a, b, c, d, and e such that a 5  b 5  c 5  d 5  e 5.
Use the long data type.
